# bin-scripts

A collection of executable scripts meant to be placed in a linux bin directory (/bin, /usr/bin, ~/.local/bin, etc.)

## Installation

For now, copy whichever scripts you need to a directory in your $PATH and then run

``` chmod +x [script] ```

## TODO

- Add an install script to copy scripts to /usr/local/bin or any other optional directory
